# Regression_Model
**Project Overview:**
The "Logistic Regression Scenario 1" project aims to explore and implement logistic regression techniques in a specific scenario. Leveraging Jupyter Notebook, the project provides an interactive platform for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of logistic regression in a real-world scenario. Through careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation, the project seeks to achieve accurate predictions and insights.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of logistic regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Utilization of Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis, code execution, and visualization.

**Project Structure:**
- **Logistic Regression Scenario 1 Completed-checkpoint.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete project code, including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **README.md:** Project README file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
